const numbers = [10, 11, 12, 12, 15];
const startIndex = 3;
const amountToDelete = 1;

numbers.splice(startIndex, amountToDelete, 13, 14);
// the second entry of 12 is removed, and we add 13 and 14 at the same index
console.log(numbers);
// returns [ 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15 ]
Here we begin with an array of numbers. We then pass the following to splice(). The index at which to begin deleting elements (3), the number of elements to be deleted (1), and the elements (13, 14) to be inserted at that same index. Note that there can be any number of elements (separated by commas) following amountToDelete, each of which gets inserted.
